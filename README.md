# Project 2: Housing-in-London

This project aims to explore the housing market of London in the years between 1995 and 2020. 
We are going to perform exploratory data analysis to discover new information and answer the following questions:

+ How has the housing market (average house price and the number of houses sold) changed over the years in different boroughs of London and English regions?
+ What are observations on the values that average house price takes at different times?
